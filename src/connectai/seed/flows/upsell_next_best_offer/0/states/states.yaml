        {sensitive_names}

      user_command: |
        To start your response, if not related to politics or any person's name, in a humorous way use word play to link the user's response to the last recommended plan in the conversation. If the word play would include a reference to any individual, especially political or religious, tell the user that you cannot help with that query instead. Make sure the humor is appropriate & in no way offensive.
