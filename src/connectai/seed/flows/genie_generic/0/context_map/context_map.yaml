    --- MOBILE NUMBER PORTABILITY (MNP) ---
    - You can seamlessly move your current phone number from any GSM mobile operator such as Jio or Vodafone onto the Airtel Network.
    - With MNP, you can painlessly make the change to start enjoying Airtel’s world of first class mobile telephony offerings, value rates and best in class customer service without going through the stress of getting a new phone number. Oh… and guess what? The service is completely FREE and your line doesn’t stop working all through the process!

    Mobile number portability process: Porting into the Airtel Network is easy. Just follow the steps below:

    Step 1: Schedule free doorstep KYC pickup & SIM delivery. This is the first step - click on the link below to get started!

    Step 2: When the agent is at your door, generate your Unique Porting Code (UPC). Just type PORT along with your 10 digit mobile number and send it to *1900*.

    Step 3: You will receive your unique code via SMS from 1901 within the next 5 minutes. (Remember that the code’s validity is only for 4 days. So only generate the code when our executive has arrived at your house.)

    Step 4: Now share your UPC along with your valid address & identity proofs with our executive.

        And that’s it, you’re done! The executive will give you your new SIM immediately which will be activated within 48 hours from the time of your document validation.

        Now just insert your SIM card and start enjoying uninterrupted network with Airtel.

    Why You Should Port Your Number to Airtel Postpaid:
        48-hour MNP Process Guarantee: Once your documents and UPC are verified and logged in by the Airtel executive, the MNP process only takes around 48 hours for transfer within the state and a maximum of 4 days for interstate transfer. Faster process means a quicker switch from your current operator to Airtel.
        No Downtime During The Day: A big worry many people have when porting SIMs is the long period between operators. However, with Airtel Postpaid, you won’t face this. You will remain connected to your current operator till the time your new connection is ready to be activated. Even then you’ll only face a few minutes of downtime at night, which you will be duly informed about.
        Easier MNP Status Tracking: Tracking your MNP status has never been easier. With Airtel Postpaid, all you have to do is download the Airtel Thanks app (available on Android and iOS), register with your port number, and track your SIM port status.
        Port to Postpaid Absolutely Free: There are no hidden charges beside the plan charges mentioned on the Airtel website. This means no activation fees, free home delivery of SIM, and no security deposit.
        Minimal Documentation: Unlike other network providers, with Airtel all you need for the documentation process is to submit a photo ID and address proof along with your number to switch from any network in India to Airtel.
        Airtel Black Facility: Apart from the exciting Airtel Postpaid plans starting at Rs 399 per month, users can now enjoy the best combo offers with Airtel Black, the company’s all-in-one plan that combines Postpaid, DTH and Fiber-optic broadband under one umbrella.
